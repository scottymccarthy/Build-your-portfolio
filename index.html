<h1>Hey there, I'm Scotty McCarthy</h1>

  </ul>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p> I've spent a large portion of life working alongside enthusiastic people and learning new fields and skills. My journey as a student at Thinkful has introduced me to a brand new world of skills and possibilities. I'm excited to flex my newly developed coding muscles to make great contributions to the world of web development.</p>
<p>The ideal scenario would be working alongside a group of people that share my same zest for creativity and helping others. I've learned that life is a work in progress and as long as we keep filing and chiseling, the possibilities of creativity and discovery are endless!</p>
